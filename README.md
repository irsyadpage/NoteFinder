<p align="center">An application for searching comment and highlight annotations in PDF documents.</p>



## üìù Features
- Search **all PDF documents** in the given folder.
  - Examine the documents' **commented annotation**.
  - Examine the documents' **highlighted annotation** (see [Limitations](#Limitations)).
- **List all found annotations with related information**: PDF filename, annotation's page number, annotation type, and annotation content.
- Keyword Filtering: User can **type keywords to filter** the comments and highlighted texts.
- Double-click to open: User can **open the annotated PDF document** by double-clicking an annotation.
- Open-at-page: Open annotated PDF documents **at a specific page number** of the annotation content (for Windows users & Adobe Acrobat Reader).
- Drag-and-drop a folder containing PDF documents into the application (for Windows user).
- Optional Features:
  -  Search PDF documents in subfolders (enabled by default).
  -  Show the document title (enabled by default). If a PDF document contains `Title` metadata, NoteFinder will show the title instead of the PDF's filename.
  -  Trim comment's newline (enabled by default). Comment annotation could contain multiple lines. NoteFinder will combine all the lines into a single line.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But Why?
While doing my research, I use a lot of annotations (highlights and comments) in the PDF documents as a method of taking notes. The problem arises when I search for the highlights and comments I put in the PDF documents. I have over 400 documents, and checking them one by one every time to find a note is improbable. Although [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) provides a field for document notes, there could be more than ten notes per document. Hence, shuffling all information into a single tiny field is inconvenient. Also, EndNote does not provide a text-highlighting feature.

On the other hand, [Mendeley Desktop App](https://www.mendeley.com/) does provide annotation searching. However, it only works for annotations that are created in the application. Existing annotation using other PDF reader apps, such as [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/), would not appear in the search result. To make matter difficult, annotations created in the Mendeley stays in Mendeley and does not apply to the original PDF document. Hence, I need to export the document if I want to see the annotations outside Mendeley Desktop App. If a new annotation is added, another export is required. 

Therefore, these problems limit the portability and ease of access to my notes (highlight and comments). Besides, Windows Search does not provide such capabilities to search for PDF annotations.


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Download & How to Use
1. Download the latest [NoteFinder release](https://github.com/irsyadler/NoteFinder/releases/).
2. Open the downloaded executable (`.exe` for Windows) or extract the archive (`.tar.gz` for macOS and Linux) to open the executable.
3. Choose a folder containing PDF documents for annotations searching by clicking the `Choose PDF Folder` button on the top. Users may also drag-and-drop a folder containing PDF documents into the NoteFinder application.
4. NoteFinder will start searching PDF annotations content in the chosen folder. If the folder contains many PDF documents, it might take time to scan and analyse each of them.
5. Double-click on a annotation result to open the related PDF documents.

Note: To enable the open-at-page feature, a user needs to click the top-left `‚â°` button. Then, click the `Choose PDF Application Executable` button to set the Adobe Acrobat Reader's executable location. An example of Adobe Acrobat Reader executable location is: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat\Acrobat.exe`.

**Important**: The NoteFinder is tested in Windows and Linux environments. Unexpected bugs might appeared in macOS. 
 

## üß™ Development & Testing
NoteFinder is developed and tested on Windows (32/64 bit) environment. But all necessary items (including icon files) are already in place for other platform distributions. To develop and test the NoteFinder, please do the following:
1. Ensure the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `18.12.1` or later installed on the system.
2. Download the source code or clone this repository by run the following commands:
    - `git clone https://github.com/irsyadler/NoteFinder`
    - `cd NoteFinder`
3. In the source code directory, run the `npm install` command to install all necessary dependencies.
4. To start the NoteFinder, run the `npm start` command.

#### Notable Code Structure
- The [src/frontend/](src/frontend/) directory contain all the files related to NoteFinder's user-interface (renderer process).
- The [src/backend/](src/backend/) directory contain all the files related to NoteFinder's Node.js environment (main process).
- The `getPageAnnotation()` function in [src/backend/data.js](src/backend/data.js) define the method of extracting annotations data from a PDF document.
- The [resources/](resources/) directory contains the build resources uses to build the NoteFinder application.

#### Build Application Distribution
- NoteFinder mostly uses [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to generate the application distribution.
- To build a distribution, run the `npx electron-builder` command inside the source code directory. This command will generate a NoteFinder distribution in the [dist/](dist/) directory.
- For custom build command, please refer to [Electron Builder - CLI](https://www.electron.build/cli). 

#### Local Files
NoteFinder store configuration data and logs persistently. These files can be found in the following:
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\NoteFinder\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/NoteFinder/`
- Linux: `~/.config/NoteFinder/`


## üö© Limitations
- The open-at-page feature **only works for [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) in Windows**. Further refinement needs to be implemented to support other PDF reader applications and platform.
- NoteFinder obtains a highlighted-text annotation by measuring the highlight's rectangle area (`x` & `y` coordinate). Therefore, the following issues arise:
  - The highlight annotation might show an empty text because the highlighted's rectangle area was smaller than the text-rectangle area defined in the PDF document.


## ¬©Ô∏è Licensing
NoteFinder is available under the [AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE) license.
